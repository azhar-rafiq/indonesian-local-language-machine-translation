## About
Indonesian Local Machine Translation initiative, a pioneering project focused on creating a powerful translation mechanism for Indonesia’s multitude of local dialects. With Indonesia’s vast linguistic diversity, encompassing over 17,000 islands, 360 ethnicities, and 840 regional languages, communication becomes a formidable obstacle, impeding social interactions and mutual comprehension among its inhabitants. Our mission is to alleviate these issues by developing a sophisticated translation system aimed at enabling smooth everyday conversations across the wide array of local dialects.
